Portfolio Site Additions (2025)

1. Full-Screen Project Popup Modal
	- Clicking any project card now opens an animated, edge‚Äëto‚Äëedge overlay (true viewport fixed) with keyboard navigation (‚Üê/‚Üí), focus trap, ESC to close, and share‚Äëlink copy.
	- Supports deep linking via URLs like `#project-mobilellm` (paste into a new tab to open directly).
	- Accessible: role="dialog", aria-modal, focus restoration, live region announcements.

2. Light / Dark Theme System
	- Theme toggle persists preference (localStorage, attribute `data-theme`).
	- Light mode introduces soft elevated cards, subtle borders, neutral grays, improved contrast, gradient headings.
	- All cards, sections, metrics, certification tiles, and modal content use CSS custom properties for consistent theming.

3. Performance & UX Enhancements
	- Hover preview manager (Netflix-style delayed preview) decoupled from modal logic.
	- Lazy reveal animations inside modal (IntersectionObserver) for long content sections.
	- Image preloading for adjacent projects to smooth navigation.

4. Implementation Notes
	- Legacy inline/static modal markup removed from `index.html`; modal DOM is injected dynamically by `ProjectDetailManager` in `script.js`.
	- Old global `.project-modal` rules deprecated in favor of `.project-modal.local` full-screen system; legacy selectors neutralized to avoid cascade conflicts.
	- CSS custom properties drive geometry animation (start card bounds ‚Üí fullscreen) via `--start-left/top/width/height`.

5. Extending
	- To add a new project: add a `.netflix-card[data-project="id"]` in HTML and define its metadata in `getProjectData()` inside `script.js`.
	- Shareable URL automatically becomes `#project-id`.

For questions or improvements: open an issue or contact via LinkedIn.

2025 Enhancements (Extended)
6. Reduced Motion Accessibility
	- Respects user OS setting `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`; disables expansion / shrink keyframes and uses instant or simple fade transitions.
	- JS guard (`prefersReducedMotion`) prevents adding animation classes; close flow falls back to lightweight fade.

7. Lightweight Analytics Hooks
	- `analyticsTrack(event, data)` stub added in `script.js` (logs to console or pushes to `dataLayer` if present).
	- Fires `project_modal_open` and `project_modal_close` with metadata (projectId, title) for easy future instrumentation.

8. Dedicated Work Page (`work.html`)
	- Consolidated project listing & carousels with the same full-screen modal behavior (no duplicate static modal markup).
	- Ensures consistent theming + accessibility (card focus, Enter activation, deep linking with hashes).

9. Consistent Close Animations
	- If no originating geometry or reduced motion preferred, modal uses a fast opacity fade instead of shrink animation.

10. Theming Parity
	- Work page includes the persistent theme toggle script; localStorage setting shared across all pages.

Quick QA for Projects and Certifications (2025)

- Open any page with project cards and click a card:
	- Expect fullscreen modal with title, details, and navigation (Prev/Next) visible.
	- Press Esc to close; focus returns to the card. Hash clears from URL.
	- Copy link (üîó) then paste in a new tab: URL should include `#project-<id>` and auto-open to that project.

- Open Certifications page and click a certification tile:
	- Expect the same fullscreen modal without Prev/Next controls.
	- URL should update to `#cert-<id>`; reload and it should auto-open.
	- Press Esc to close; hash should clear.

- Keyboard and accessibility:
	- Tab to a card/tile and press Enter to open; Shift+Tab to navigate back after close.
	- Arrow keys (‚Üê/‚Üí) navigate projects when project modal is open.

- QR share:
	- In a project modal, click QR; overlay appears; close it and ensure modal remains.

If anything differs, check `main.js` console for warnings and ensure all pages load `main.js` (not `script.js`).
