PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
Software Developer | Tempus 	Oct 2024 – Present | USA
•	Developed secure, high-throughput backend services using FastAPI and integrated them with LLMs via OpenAI GPT-4 and LangChain, enabling oncology researchers to auto-summarize 2TB+ of unstructured patient notes in under 10 seconds per request.
•	Built a GenAI-enabled clinical documentation assistant, deployed on GCP using Kubernetes and Docker, which reduced manual reporting time by ~4 hours per oncologist weekly through prompt-engineered summarization and keyword extraction.
•	Designed and implemented Java-based orchestration logic to interface with AI pipelines, providing queue-based job handling for LLM inference tasks and ensuring consistent delivery under high concurrency.
•	Collaborated with data engineering teams to create tokenized RESTful APIs in Java 17 and Spring Boot, enforcing JWT authentication, rate limiting, and input sanitization for HIPAA-compliant data access.
•	Led the refactoring and modularization of existing Java microservices, improving unit test coverage from 62% to 91%, reducing code complexity, and cutting deployment-related bugs by 45% over two release cycles.

Software Development Associate – Client: T-Mobile | Deloitte 	May 2020 – Aug 2023 | India
•	Designed and deployed 40+ RESTful microservices using Java 8, Spring Boot, and Spring Security, integrated with Oracle/PostgreSQL, processing 120K+ daily transactions across telecom systems.
•	Engineered backend modules for asynchronous processing with JMS and Java Mail API, enabling real-time alerts and batch notifications, improving incident response by 38%.
•	Developed internal web applications with Java-based APIs, ReactJS, HTML5, and Bootstrap, reducing ticket resolution time by 25% for support teams.
•	Automated cloud operations with custom Java agents, streamlining AWS S3 cleanups and system health checks, cutting manual intervention by 60+ hours/month.
•	Optimized multi-table joins and transactional queries via Spring Data JPA custom finder methods, reducing database response times by 30% on high-traffic endpoints.
